**🚀 Thumbnail Crafter Request 🚀**

Hello Thumbnail Crafter! I'm working on a **YouTube video** titled **"10 Mind-Blowing Space Discoveries"** and need a captivating thumbnail that stands out. Here's what I have in mind:

- **Main Theme**: Space and discovery 🌌
- **Visual Elements**:
  - A vibrant image of a galaxy or nebula as the background
  - An eye-catching image of a telescope or astronaut in the foreground
  - Include the text "10 Mind-Blowing Discoveries" with a font that's easy to read from a distance
- **Color Scheme**: Dark blues and purples for the galaxy background, with bright accents (like neon pink or electric blue) for text and highlights to make it pop 🎨
- **Style Notes**:
  - The overall feel should be mysterious but inviting, aiming to spark curiosity
  - Use the Rule of Thirds to place key elements effectively
  - Ensure the text is legible and contrasts well against the background

**Additional Details**:
- I prefer a minimalist approach, with clean lines and not too cluttered
- The video is educational but aimed at a general audience, so the thumbnail should be broadly appealing
- If possible, add a subtle visual cue to indicate the video is part of a series (like a small logo or number in a corner)
- Create the picture in 16:9 format!

Could you help me design a thumbnail that meets these specifications? Feel free to use your expertise to adjust any element if you think it would enhance the final result. Thank you! 🙏
