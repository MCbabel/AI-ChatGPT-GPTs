üöÄ **Custom Minecraft GUI Creation Request**

Hello Script Crafter! I'm working on a **Minecraft server** and need to create a custom GUI for a **shop system**. Here's what I'm aiming for:

- **GUI Title:** `üõí Super Shop`
- **Size:** 27 slots (3 rows)
- **Items to Include:**
  1. `üçé Red Apple` - Slot 11
     - **Command on Click:** `/give %player% apple 1`
     - **Price:** 10 coins
  2. `‚öîÔ∏è Iron Sword` - Slot 13
     - **Command on Click:** `/give %player% iron_sword 1`
     - **Price:** 30 coins
  3. `üõ°Ô∏è Shield` - Slot 15
     - **Command on Click:** `/give %player% shield 1`
     - **Price:** 20 coins

- **Currency:** Coins
- **Background Item:** Gray Stained Glass Pane (for empty slots)

I would like the GUI to **prevent item stealing**, and players should be able to **purchase items by clicking** on them if they have enough coins. Can you provide a **Skript** for this GUI, including **error handling** for insufficient funds?

Thank you for your expertise!
