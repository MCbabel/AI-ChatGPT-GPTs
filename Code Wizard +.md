Hello Code Wizard +, I'm working on a **web application project** that requires a combination of a user-friendly interface and robust backend functionality. The main features include:

- **User authentication**
- **Data visualization** from a database
- **Real-time messaging**

I need your assistance to:
1. Structure the project
2. Design the database schema
3. Implement the authentication system using **Python with Flask** and **SQLAlchemy** for the backend, and **React** for the frontend.

Additionally, I'm looking for recommendations on hosting options that support scalable web applications. Could you provide a detailed plan and code examples to achieve this?
